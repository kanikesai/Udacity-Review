You are almost there! :smile:\n### You have done a great job in the Antivirus Communication section and Azure backup and site recovery part. :clap:\n- Good Job with specifying \"An effective disaster recovery solution needs both backup and site recovery, since both capture data and include a restore semantics component. Backup ensures that your data is safe and recoverable, while Site Recovery ensures that your workloads are available in the event of a failure.\"\n- You have correctly mentioned \"RPO is the maximum amount of time you can afford to lose data without impacting your business significantly.\"\n\n### However, there are some changes needed to be done to meet the Rubric requirements: :warning:\n* In Q#1, you also need to mention the services for each server as well. Make sure to list any relevant backups or antivirus for each server.\n* In Q#2, you need to specify the services that need to be installed on each Azure VM as well. \n* All servers will be created as an Azure VM (IaaS) including backup and antivirus servers.\n* Please update your cost estimates after making the above-said changes.\n* We just have a single server for each purpose like there is only one web server, one backup server etc. These servers will need to be updated and occasionally upgraded. Will their site be available 24*7, 365 days in such a scenario?\n* You missed answering whether or not VM type / size can be changed after deployment.\n* Your response tells what are ARM templates, but it doesn't talk about the benefits of ARM Templates. \n* \"Which backup strategy consumes more disc space?\" - Your response is incorrect for this question. \n\nI have tried to provide detailed comments to help you understand what changes are required. Hope that helps! I am sure you will pass this project soon!\n\nKeep learning and keep growing!\n\n## Review these resources for further reading and enhancement: \n- [Azure Site Recovery](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/site-recovery/)\n- [RTO and RPO](https://www.enterprisestorageforum.com/management/rpo-and-rto-understanding-the-differences/)","hidden":false,"previous_submission_id":null,"nomination":null,"language":"en-us","rubric_id":3650,"escalated_at":null,"enrollment_node_key":"nd090","enrollment_id":"7d87467e-9931-11ec-9222-4fe27e99d267","plagiarism_source_url":null,"ungradeable_tag":null,"plagiarism_judgement":null,"is_demerit":false,"project_id":819,"project":{"id":819,"name":"Moving from On-Prem to the Azure Cloud","is_cert_project":false,"is_career":false}}]
